# Earthquake Data Analysis Project üåç

Welcome to the Earthquake Data Analysis project! This repository contains a mini-project that analyzes the "Significant Earthquakes 1965-2016" dataset. The project involves various data manipulation, reshaping, and visualization tasks to derive insights from the data.

## Project Overview üìä

### 1. Data Manipulation
- Filled missing values in the 'Depth' column with the mean depth.
- Removed the 'Time' column as it was not needed for the analysis.
- Split the 'Date' column into 'Year', 'Month', and 'Day' for better date handling.

### 2. Categorize Numerical Data
- Categorized earthquake magnitudes into three categories: 'Low', 'Medium', and 'High'.

### 3. Data Reshaping
- Used the `melt()` function to transform the data into a long format.
- Applied the `pivot()` function to create a summary table of average depths by year and magnitude category.

### 4. Data Visualization
Created four different types of charts to visualize the data:
- **Line Chart**: Shows the yearly trend of earthquake magnitudes.
- **Bar Chart**: Displays the average monthly earthquake magnitudes.
- **Scatter Plot**: Plots the locations of earthquakes by magnitude.
- **Histogram**: Illustrates the distribution of earthquake magnitudes.

### 5. Date Transformation
- Extracted the year and month from the 'Date' column.
- Resampled the data by year to calculate the mean magnitude.

## Getting Started üöÄ

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
